# Map

- This is a typical C++ map.
- It's declaration is as follows:

```
Map<string, int> myMap = {};
```

- This was chosen as the design of declaration to make it as easy on the eyes as possible.
- Also, the map can be initialized with values using a key: value format.

```
Map<string, int> myMapWithValues = {
    "FirstValue": 123,
    "SecondValue": 456
};
```
